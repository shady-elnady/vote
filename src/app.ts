 * Purpose: Sets up the web server to handle requests and responses.

 * - Handles an incoming `GET /` request and sends a response.

 * Middleware: helmet
 * Purpose: Enhances security by setting appropriate HTTP headers.
 * Features:
 * - Prevents common vulnerabilities like XSS, clickjacking, and MIME sniffing.
 * Example:
 * - Adds the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to prevent browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type.
 * Usage:
 * - Automatically secures your API with default settings.

 * Purpose: Logs HTTP requests for debugging and monitoring purposes.

 * - "dev": Provides concise colored logs for development.
 * - "combined": Detailed logs for production, including timestamps and response statuses.
 * Example:
 * - Logs: "GET /home 200 5.432 ms - 13"

 * Example:
 * - Incoming request: `{ "name": "John" }`
 * - Accessible in code: `req.body.name === "John"`

 * Example:
 * - Incoming form: `<form><input name="name" value="John"></form>`
 * - Accessible in code: `req.body.name === "John"`

 * Purpose: Prevents NoSQL Injection attacks.
 * How It Works:
 * - Strips out `$` and `.` from request data to avoid malicious MongoDB queries.
 * Example:
 * - Malicious input: `{ "$gt": "" }`
 * - Sanitized output: `{ }`
 */

 * Middleware: xss-clean

 * - Malicious input: `<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>`
 * - Sanitized output: `alert('Hacked!')`

 * Middleware: cors
 * Purpose: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

 * - Allows your API to handle requests from other domains securely.

 * - `credentials: true`: Supports cookies and authentication headers across domains.
 * - `origin: true`: Dynamically allows all origins.
 * Example:
 * - Frontend hosted on `http://example.com` can access API on `http://api.example.com`.

When an error occurs in the application,
